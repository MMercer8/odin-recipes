# odin-recipes
Basic recipe website
Website to consist of main index page with links to recipes.


Remember the Recipe page you created as practice from the previous lesson? Well, it’s rather plain looking, isn’t it? Let’s fix that by adding some CSS to it!

# How you actually style it is completely open, but you should use the external CSS method (for this practice and moving forward). 
--You should also try to use several of the properties mentioned in the section above (color, background color, typography properties, etc). 
--Take some time to play around with the various properties to get a feel for what they do. 

For now, don’t worry at all about making it look good. This is just to practice and get used to writing CSS, not to make something to show off on your resume, so feel free to go a little crazy for now.

We haven’t covered how to use a custom font for the font-family property yet, so for now take a look at CSS Fonts for a list of generic font families to use, and CSS Web Safe Fonts for a list of fonts that are web safe. Web safe means that these are fonts that are installed on basically every computer or device (but be sure to still include a generic font family as a fallback).
